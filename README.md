# Northwind-Sales-Analysis-MySQL-PowerBI
Comprehensive Sales &amp; Operations EDA for Northwind Traders. Leveraged MySQL (SQL) for data profiling and Power BI (DAX) for dynamic visualization and strategic insights.

üéØ Project Overview:
This project executes a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Northwind Traders historical dataset. The workflow showcases end-to-end data analysis skills, transitioning from raw data querying in MySQL to sophisticated data modeling and interactive business intelligence using Power BI.

 The primary goal was to provide strategic, evidence-based insights across core business pillars: Sales Performance, Customer Behavior, Organizational Structure, and Supply Chain efficiency.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack:
Component	Technology	Purpose in Project
Data Exploration & Metrics	MySQL (SQL)	Used for initial data profiling, complex multi-table joins, feature engineering, and calculating raw metrics (e.g., Net Revenue, AOV).
Data Modeling & Logic	Power BI Desktop (DAX)	Used to build a dimensional model (Star Schema), create sophisticated measures (AOV, Tenure), and define hierarchies (PATH function).
Visualization & Reporting	Power BI Desktop	Created interactive dashboards to translate analytical findings into clear, actionable business insights.
Version Control	Git / GitHub	For documentation, file management, and transparent version control.

üìÅ Repository Contents
File/Folder	Description
01_SQL_EDA/Northwind Sales Project (EDA SQL Queries).sql	The source of truth for the raw analysis. Contains all 14+ specific SQL queries used for data exploration, cleaning, metric calculation, and anomaly detection.
02_PowerBI_Visualizations/Northwinds Sales Analysis Project.pbix	The final reporting solution. Contains the completed dimensional model, all DAX measures, and the finalized interactive report pages.

üí° Key Findings & Strategic Insights
The following insights are a result of transforming the initial SQL queries into final Power BI visualizations:

1. Sales & Customer Performance
Analysis Focus	Power BI Visual Used	Strategic Insight
Order Value Distribution	Card Visuals (Min, Median, Max)	Comparison of Average vs. Median Order Value revealed a positive skew, confirming that a few extremely large transactions are inflating the mean AOV.
Customer Risk	Table / Bar Chart (Top Customers)	Identified the Top N customers responsible for the majority of revenue, highlighting significant revenue concentration risk that warrants account prioritization (Pareto Principle).
Revenue Trend	Line Chart	Confirmed year-over-year growth and established a predictable Q4/Q1 seasonal peak, which should guide inventory and marketing budgets.

2. Employee Structure & Operations
Analysis Focus	Power BI Visual Used	Key DAX / Modeling Technique
Reporting Structure	Matrix Visual	Used the PATH and LOOKUPVALUE DAX functions to define the Manager ‚Üí Subordinate hierarchy and measure the Span of Control.
Tenure Distribution	Clustered Column Chart	Calculated employee experience using DATEDIFF and grouped the results into 1-year bins to assess workforce stability and turnover risk.
Span of Control	Matrix Count(EmployeeID)	Confirmed the organization operates with a flat structure due to the wide span of control (high count of direct reports) seen under top managers.

3. Product & Supply Chain Analysis
Analysis Focus	Power BI Visual Used	Operational Insight
Product Pricing	Clustered Column Chart (Histogram)	Grouped product prices into $20 bins to define the core competitive price tier where the majority of inventory is clustered, and identify premium outliers.
Supplier Risk	Bar/Pie Chart (Product Count)	Identified suppliers responsible for the majority of the product catalogue, confirming supplier concentration risk and dependency on a few key vendors.
Pricing Volatility	Table (Min/Median/Max Price per Supplier)	Evaluated the price spread (Min to Max) for each supplier to identify partners with high price volatility, informing procurement negotiation strategy.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Technical Techniques
The following are examples of specific technical solutions implemented within the project:

DAX (Power BI)
Employee Hierarchy: Creation of the Employee Path column using PATH(EmployeeID, ReportsTo) and subsequent extraction of names using PATHITEM and LOOKUPVALUE.

Time Intelligence: Use of DATEDIFF to calculate employee tenure and shipping duration days.

AOV Measure: DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])

SQL (MySQL/EDA Queries)
Net Revenue: Calculation of revenue at the line-item level using the formula: SUM(OD.UnitPrice * OD.Quantity * (1 - OD.Discount)).

Customer Tiering: Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs/WITH clause) to calculate the total number of orders per customer, followed by an aggregation to find the Average Orders Per Customer.

Cross-Domain Joins: Complex JOIN operations across Customers, Orders, Order Details, Products, and Suppliers to connect financial metrics with supplier and product dimensions.
